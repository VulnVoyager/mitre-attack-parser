# MITRE ATT&CK Threat Group Parser

A high-performance Python tool for SOC analysts and Threat Intelligence researchers to aggregate, filter, and deduplicate APT group data from multiple authoritative sources.
Combines structured data from MITRE ATT&CK (v18.1+) with the community-driven APT Groups & Operations spreadsheet (scanning all regional tabs) to provide a unified, verified list of threat actors targeting specific sectors.

### Key Features
- Multi-Source Aggregation: Simultaneously queries:
- Official MITRE ATT&CK releases (configurable version).
- APT Groups & Operations Google Sheet (automatically scans all 8+ regional tabs).
- Smart Deduplication: Automatically merges duplicates. If a group exists in both sources, it prioritizes the rich structured data from MITRE while flagging it as "Verified by Multiple Sources".
- Sector-Specific Search: Enhanced lookup with synonyms (e.g., searching healthcare also matches medical, hospital, pharma, медицина).
### Quick Start
